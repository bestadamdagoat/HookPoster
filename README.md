# HookPoster
A way to easily and automatically post to a webhook. Made for Discord.
# config.ini
test_webhook = link to the webhook where you want to send the test webhook to (ex. https://webhook.com/test)

name = The thing that you want to show above the title (ex. Unconfigured HookPoster)

author_url = The url that's embedded into the name (ex. https://github.com/bestadamdagoat/HookPoster)

icon_url = Shows next to the name (ex. https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66372881?v=4)
# webhooklist.txt
A list of all the webhooks you want to post to. Seperate all links by a new line.
# COMMON ERRORS
If the webhook fails authentication, make sure any links you give are properly formatted (ex. https://www.google.com). If you don't want a link, leave it blank.
